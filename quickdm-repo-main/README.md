Quick Dungeon Master (QuickDM for short) is a website that allows you to take simple notes for everything running up in your sessions.

### QuickDM offers various features for Dungeon Masters, such as:
* A textbox for making notes;
* A menu with numerous dices for your rolls;
* A customizable "character health bar editor" for your battles.

QuickDM is a simple and fast solution that offers a customizable environment for busy DMs, and will soon be hosted on GitHub Pages!
